# _Food-Delivery-Static-Site_

Site was created using plain HTML, SASS and JavaScript.
There is only a landing page in the project, because only it was available on the design.

Main goals of this project was to show my skills regarding Responsive Web Design

The original design can be found on Figma Community here: [link]
